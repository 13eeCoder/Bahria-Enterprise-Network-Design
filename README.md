# University Enterprise Network Design & CMS Integration
**Developer:** Bee 

## 📌 Project Overview
A full-scale network infrastructure simulation for a dual-campus university. This project integrates hardware networking logic with a functional software-based Web Portal (CMS) to simulate a real-world campus environment.

## 🛠️ Key Components
* **Dual-Campus Connectivity:** Inter-campus communication established via Serial links.
* **Network Segmentation:** Logical grouping of departments using VLANs (Campus-wide).
* **Dynamic Routing:** Implementation of RIPv2 for automated traffic path management.
* **Server Infrastructure:** Centralized DNS and HTTP services for the `bahria.edu.pk` domain.

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications
* **Protocol:** RIPv2 (Routing Information Protocol)
* **IP Management:** Automated DHCP pools for multi-building setups.
* **Topology:** Hierarchical Tree-based design connecting Main and Branch campuses.
* **Services:** Integrated Web, DNS, and External Email simulation.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `/Network`: The `.pkt` Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file.
* `/CMS_Portal`: HTML/CSS source files for the Student, Faculty, and Staff login pages.
* `/Docs`: Final technical report and network diagrams.

## 💻 Software Used
* **Cisco Packet Tracer:** For network simulation and testing.
